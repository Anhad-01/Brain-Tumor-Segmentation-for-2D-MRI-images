# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-for-2D-MRI-images
Implemented U-Net CNN architecture for binary segmentation of brain tumors in 2D MRI scans using the LGG dataset. It includes preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization), model training, and evaluation with metrics like Dice score, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
